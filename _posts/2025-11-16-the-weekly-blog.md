A friend of mine has a blog similar to mine that has helped inspire stuff I've done over here, and a hallmark of his blog is the weekly post. In his weekly post, which he has posted every Sunday for years, he summarizes what goes on in his life, whether it be technical or random. Basically, shitposting.

I feel that overall, the weekly blog should just be about anything that has happened, technical or not. But I will try to have a section where I go through some interesting topic I have learned in my more career based endeavors. I also want to give thoughts on other interests of mine, mainly exercise, language learning, and reading. 

This is building off my ["Daily Run Page,"](https://niklichang.github.io/2024/12/02/the-daily-run), which I have stopped and instead going to incorporate into this page daily.
