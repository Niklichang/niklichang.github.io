The further you climb, the further you fall.

With every failure, with every dissapointment, one falls further into the pit of despair.

But what happens if we reach the top? 

Minds are like models, yet we are trapped inside our own conscience. How do we expect to change the paradigm from within?

Is there a point?

In the end we can only try.

One day, but every day.
