This is the the daily run, which is the start of a larger plan to improve the individual holistically (another post will eventually cover this). My goal with this post is to update it every single day with what I ran, thoughts on the run, and other miscellaneous ideas. Records can be accessed on strava *[here](https://www.strava.com/athletes/117513725)*.

*Update on 01/13/25:* This page will most likely be changed to a 6 days run and 1 day strength workout per week (no longer a "daily" run), but the intent is still the same. Run faster, get fitter, build habits.

<br/>

**02/26/25, Day 45**: 3.51mi easy. Almost skipped out today. After yesterday's workout I went to a boxing free trial lesson which was surprisingly exhausting. In hindsight it makes sense though. Today the strava got even more messed up. On a basic level it was the same mistake; basically I entered the kilometers into the manual input for miles. However, this time for some reason the garmin was recording in kilometers during the run. When I went to do the manual input, the only difference between the garmin time and my time seemed to be 500m. Yet, when I inputted it all the tracking software changed it to miles. As such I just took this run off my strava since I was getting PB's on a couple distances. Hopefully by tommorow I can figure out the solution.

Sometimes I feel no motivation to get up and run. Today I gave in, but later in the day found motivation to complete the run. This is definitely not sustainable for the future, especially as classes get more hectic and I have other priorities that I will need to attend to (more on this later).

<br/>

**02/25/25, Day 44**: 3.84mi easy. Felt super good back from recovery. Still have a little ankle niggle that I will need to pay attention to again, but it is something I've seen before so not surprising. Accidentally put like 6.18 miles on my strava since the input in garmin is miles for the treadmill calibration, and the run was 6.18km, so I made a mistake and cannot change it. No worries though, it just seems like I ran 6.18 miles at 6:34 or something pace oops.

<br/>

**02/23/25, Day 43**: Small workout today. Got food poisoning on 2/21, so yesterday didn't do anything. Only did bench and tri today, just realized how bad the gym is apart from the treadmills. 

Crazy how Haidilao can give food poisoning, but at this point I shouldn't have any expectations about China. What also confuses me is that I was the only one who got food poisoning out of the group of 5. Must have just been a singular piece of something bad. Feeling a lot better today but yesterday was a mess. Hopefully I can get back to running by 2/25, but tomorrow seems like a bit of a stretch. 

<br/>

**02/21/25, Day 42**: 4.60mi easy with strides. 100th activity on Strava, that's nice! When I watch a good video, time just flies by while running. Today I finished up Moonchannel's video on why you always kill gods in JRPGs. I love his channel because it is a history channel disguised through the process of explaning the manifestations history has through modern culture and society. Pretty awkward way to explain it, but I feel so much more knowledgeable about why society in South Korea and Japan are functioning today through such an engaging and informational medium.

One collegiate runner and part time youtuber I watch, Yaseen Abdalla, really inspired me to do this. I was watching his vlogs leading up to the Paris Olympics, and I loved his treadmill he had in his house. He explained a little about the stigma around training on a treadmill as well as how he loved to watch TV shows while doing his easy runs. While I love TV shows, with no real way to watch it in China without paying, I am shifting mine to more constructive media. I hope to transition into listening to audiobooks as well as watching Chinese content to increase my Chinese input further.

<br/>

**02/20/25, Day 41**: 4.14mi easy. Definitely easy this time. After a harder day yesterday, I really wanted to tone it down, especially to emphasize the idea of easier and hard days as I transition into a more systematic approach to training. Also, I had a little feeling of inflammation on the outer part of my left knee. Felt better after running more today, but obviously a good idea to take it easy. 

Got to remind myself of the slow and steady pace of stretching. I have never held a habit of stretching because it is somewhat tought to record incremental progress; there are only big milestones that you realize after you achieve it. I try to convince myself that everyday I'm getting more flexible, but I can't see the difference between one day and the next. That's why building the habit is so important!

Went to probably one of the coolest classes today. A research seminar course with a semester long research project culminating in a student poster session involving various faculty. No one can hope for better in terms of talking to professors. Looking forward to that class but not all the other work from other classes.

<br/>

**02/19/25, Day 40**: 4.13mi easier. Tried to monitor heartrate, but I slowly realized that my heartrate was climbing even though I was going at such a slow pace. Such is running at the early stages. Anyways, tried to keep heartrate low, then ended with some hill sprints. I find ending the run with strides or short hill sprints on the treadmill is great because running for long periods at a very specific pace lacks the variation that you find by running outside.

I am also stretching a lot more. I realized that one thing that I actually want to make headway in is flexibility, and it is something that will take a while to achieve. It makes sense that to actually enlongate the tendon/muscle, basic changes have to happen in a slow but steady process. 

I also want to read more into structuring a running training plan. Anyyone can go online and see what the 2:05 marathon athlete is doing for his training in a day, but actual understanding and insight in building your own plan is a lot more complex. 

<br/>

**02/18/25, Day 39**: 3.78mi easy. Need to settle in and build some base/injury resistance. I accidentally reset the treadmill, so I did not do the save & calibrate feature this time, but tomorrow I will for sure. I have been focusing a lot on stretching both before and after the run for mobility and injury prevention as well. Feels very refreshing. 

Classes are somewhat of a mess right now. I came here to learn Chinese, but I realized that I can't take a class taught in Chinese. Today I just came out of a Chinese taught class without knowing a single idea explained in that class. However, hopes are there are extra classes released by the School of Chinese as a Second Language in which I can enroll in soon. Otherwise the entire learning process is on me, yet again. I find that over here it is still extremely easy to fall into a complacent lifestyle, surrounded by international students and taking classes taught in English, having little time for language learning. Working on that.

<br/>

**02/17/25, Day 38**: 2.53mi easy. Everything just easy... for now. Having wifi in the gym is nice; I can watch anything I want on my phone while running. I have finally found a nice place with all good facilities, but still need to figure out the watch distance delta. 5.01km = 3.11mi, so why 2.53? Compared to last time, .813 vs .834 proportional difference, which is somewhat consistent.

Just looked it up and apparently there is a "Save & Calibrate" option to manually save after every run. Going to try that out tomorrow.

<br/>

**02/16/25, Day 37**: 1.31mi easy. Finally back. Will still have to settle in for a bit before this can become a consistent, everyday thing again due to classes and adjusting to China. 北大 is great. Cool friends, nice campus, and I finally got to go to the gyms and see the ping pong places. Hopefully that will work out. Basically a lot better emotionally and hopefully physically soon.

In terms of the run, I feel like the Garmin is miscalculating it. In San Diego, I thought it was a bit off. In Chengdu, I disregarded the one time run due to a run-down treadmill. Finally, in Beijing, now that I have tested one of the new treadmills I will be most of the time, it still seems off. The treadmill said 2.52km, which is 1.57 miles. Pretty inaccurate. Will probably have to recalibrate my watch. 

New update: I'm not going to put it at the top since traveling abroad is temporary, but while I am here I will probably treat this as somewhat of a blog if I am feeling up to it. It would be fun, and I think it is best that this place is pure, unadulterated thoughts in contrast to my other posts where I go back and edit stuff.

<br/>

**02/06/25, Day 36**: 4.20mi easy. Wrote the previous run just now for reference. Things are a lot different out here in China, and it really tests my drive to continue running, which so far I have failed miserably at. Not much else that I want to say on the matter but I have lost a lot of fitness, and once I reach Beijing things will stabilize. Going to have to remove the "Number of Days Missed" section, RIP. I feel that I made it at a time where I knew that my streak was slipping away (leaving for China). Also, I feel like it is an unhealthy way to approach trying to run more, as touched upon in a previous post about building habits. See you sometime soon.

<br/>

**01/27/25, Day 35**: 3.44mi easy. 

<br/>

**01/18/25, Day 34**: 2.04mi hills. Early run today because no one is up yet. This has definitely been the slowest run I have ever done. 14.55/mi is almost walking honestly. Also, I could not actually run up the hill for a mile straight. I had to stop near 0.8 miles because there was a little ache that started on the back left of my right foot which I probably attribute to a lack of ankle strength for running up hill. 

I recently watched a video on the Western States 100 and was confused on why they were running so slow. Trail runners are truly built different.

<br/>

**01/17/25, Day 33**: 1.25 hills. Felt extremely tiring on the way up, which is expected.

Also expected, but somewhat surprising, was how hard it was for me to actually run up here. Got some people on the retreat acting like my mom (im mad). The run tomorrow will probably better due to the light.

Short run today. Running this steep of hills in the dark is not safe, especially when the ground is extremely uneven. Also got lost twice on the run and ran into a rv van with what I swear was a man breathing inside. Overall a great experience because new experiences are always nice. Hearing dogs howl in the night is both a surreal and scary experience. Honestly felt like urbexing; you are always on your toes and looking around you for signs of movement. Maybe it makes me weird that I find excitement in the fact that there could be an animal waiting to attack me. But makes for a great experience. Looking forward for tomorrow morning when it is light. 

<br/>

**01/16/25, Day 32**: 4.32mi threshold? I don't know, it seems like the treadmill times are a lot slower than the time recorded on my watch, and I don't know how to update it. I went around what the treadmill said to be 10:30 to 10:10 pace, however, my watch is saying 9:18/mi. I don't know if this is cheating or what.

Anyways today it felt as if my knee was about to flare up, but then it subsided and I felt fine the rest of the run. Excited to see what I run out in a new environment (secret) the upcoming days.

<br/>

**01/15/25, Day 31**: 4.25mi threshold. Still having this new problem with my right knee. This time, though, I started feeling it, and then it slowly subsided. Very odd and also a bit scary. I'm not sure yet if I should just keep running and see if the problem dissapears. I'm making sure to warm up properly and go through a thorough stretching routine afterwards. 

<br/>

**01/14/25, Day 30**: 2.32mi easy road/treadmill. Very dissapointing day to say the least. So I have been working on treadmill lately mainly to the efficiency of the gym as well as the environment for both prerun warmup and postrun stretching. However, since running on a treadmill provides no draft against the air, my long hair ends up bobbing in front of my face instead of flowing behind like on a normal run. Naturally, I forgot to bring my hat to the gym, so I ran back to my apartment in hopes of grabbing my hat and coming back to the treadmill. Low and behold I forgot my keys while on my way back to my apartment. Not wanting to mess up further, I just turned around and headed back to the gym to complete my run no matter my hair status. 2.32 miles in, and there arises a very acute stabbing pain on the back right of my right knee, near the hamstring. At that point I just stopped running. I know my body and my pains. Some say that pains that are familiar are good since you know what they are. This was definitely something new, so I just had to stop running. I wouldn't say I'm extremely surprised; I have expressed worry over my right knee. Hopefully this is not a persistent problem.

After getting off the treadmill I decided to do some strength and conditioning work to finish off my workout. You might say, why would I work out my knee when it is in pain? The pain was like a stabbing sort of pain on impact with the ground. Working on leg strengthening exercises will not put that sort of sudden impact on the joints and tendons so I deemed it ok. Overall horrible workout today but we will bounce back tomorrow. hopefully.

<br/>

**01/13/25, Day 29**: 3.86mi threshold on treadmill. Very weird run today because it felt so tough. Heartbeat was definitely higher than my previous run, and I ran about the same amount of time but less distance. Very weird but can most likely be explained by two things. First, I ran on different treadmills. The second treadmill was in a gym with a lot more people, so I think the temperature difference is a factor. Second, I actually feel a bit sick right now. When running, I could feel my throat hurt every time I swallowed. Hopefully will be better soon. I also need to buy a pair of running headphones, I think that paired with treadmill will be a great way to get miles in, especially studying abroad. 

Anywas still have DOMS from yesterday's workout which is nice. Something upset my stomach and hopefully it is not the increased amount of protein powder and milk intake recently. 

Good progress overall and although I don't feel noticeable improvement, this is a first step. Also stretching which is goood

<br/>

**01/12/25, Day 28**: No run today, but I will still count it as a day in the streak, and here is why. Today I worked out in the gym. I think that it is necessary to do workouts in the gym even as a runner. Today I did all upper body, but I want to definitely focus more on the lower body for strength and conditioning purposes.

That being said, as a "casual" runner I think it takes too long to do both running and gym in one day (at least for now), thus skipping a day of running. I still want to add this day to the streak though because it is part of improving running and becoming a better athlete. 

<br/>

**01/11/25, Day 27**: 4.23mi progression run. First time doing a real training run on the treadmill, and it's not as bad as I thought. As an avid Yaseen follower, I shall enjoy treadmills. A lot of people hate running on a treadmill, but I think it is convenient and a very efficient way to train. I honestly do not get why people say that running on a treadmill is too easy or is not the "same" as outside. It definitely does feel longer than running outside in a sense that I keep checking times and paces and things seem to progress slower. This is probably just a matter of perspective, and as Yaseen says one will get used to it over time. 

<br/>

**01/10/25, Day 26**: 4.43mi threshold effort with Strides. Running with others makes you faster...

Skipped the previous way due to lack of time on the way to school. A good restart to running in a different environment.

<br/>

**01/08/25, Day 25**: 1.18mi classic. But the reason is that I am fairly busy at night, so I need to get the run done earlier today. What I didn't expect was the effect the sun has on my running. Usually I run earlier mornings or nights, and I believe at this time the sun shining affects running to a very noticeable amount. Thus my low mileage. What is more crazy is that the temperature seemed to be the same as when I would run at night: Low 50's. However with the sun out it felt so much worse. Note for future runs

<br/>

**01/07/25, Day 24**: 4.19mi easy. True to my word and increasing mileage. Introducing very brief warm up along with stretching afterwords. Today my lower calf area still felt very stiff. Maybe there is lingering soreness from skiing but that was 3 days ago sooo. Knee is also causing concern; I think there has been aggravation also due to skiing; will have to work on a solution. 

<br/>

**01/06/25, Day 23**: 3.00mi apparently unproductive, and apparently detraining now... Garmin training status is harsh. I am sad. and bad. A lot of people focus too much on small details. It is easy to be caught up in the numbers of things when in reality you need to spot trends. Instead of constantly looking at your training status day by day, look at the monthly: If there is an upward trend, you are doing something right.

My case seems to be different. Today the run was somewhat physically draining, in the sense that I'm not used to running 3 miles. Yes, I have taken 2 days off my bad (1/2 due to skiing). However, I realize that there is one simple solution, at least kind of. I just need to run more. 

There are two different ways to introduce progressive overload, and therefore, more efficient improvement overall. First is running for longer. The second is running at a higher intensity. It is somewhat obvious that the best indicator of your current performance is what you have been displaying most recently. As such, I have been doing horrible. One 12 mile run, then a bunch of 1-2 milers. Seems pretty telling, huh

Obviously need to put more time/effort into running to improve. However, I have also identified two areas that can only be a detriment to training. First is my lack of mobility. Flexibility has always been one of my worst areas, and any sort of athlete needs it. Second is what seems to be runner's knee. My right knee starts to ache periodically, and more often the longer a distance I run. I believe it is due to an imbalance of muscle; my left leg is relatively stronger due to extensive racket sports. Therefore I believe it is in my best interest to incorporate some pre-run activation exercises, stretching, and strength and conditioning for my knee.

Cya tomorrow (please)

<br/>

**01/03/25, Day 22**: 1.18mi easy. sound familiar?

<br/>

**01/02/25, Day 21**: 2.12mi super easy. Garmin says I have been either maintaining or unproductive in running. I don't know how accurate that is but it definitely is demoralizing. Maybe I am running to slow.. 

<br/>

**01/01/25, Day 20**: 1.19mi easy. what a way to start of 2025 (just kidding). After playing sports, I hate to have to run on the same day, which has been the case for two days now. However, sometimes you just need to go the extra mile.

<br/>

**12/31/24, Day 19**: 1.21mi easy today. There goes my streak again? One thing I believe and am still working on is the idea that breaks and entertainment should be productive. In this way, it is not seen as something bad when you are having fun, or something frivolous. But instead, taking a break is for the purpose of being more efficient in productive areas. The fact that you take some time to relax your mind means that entertainment will help you refocus on more important tasks. In that sense, having fun is part of productivity. With this mindset, I believe one can change the approach to self improvement in any area. Or maybe I'm making excuses for missing a day of running :&#124;

<br/>

**12/29/24, Day 18**: 12.02mi at 9:50 pace. Insane to say the least. This run went from an amazing run in the first half to a harrowing experience in the second. It was like turning back at the halfway point was a switch that turned the run from good to bad. Maybe it has to do with the gel I ate at the halfway point. Upset stomach so bad to the point that I had to walk for a bit. Then a certain pain in my knee that seemed unbearable. Safe to say this was not exactly the right decision to go on such a long run at this point. But sitting at home, doing nothing, and also a certain video from Ran to Japan prompted me to do more. Running 1 to 2 miles a day during a break, when I have infinite time, is like a creeping itch working through my conscience. One needs to believe in the hard work the the progress that they can achieve. In the end I just hope that these shocks don't affect my long term running goals, as is usually the case when someone starts something new with too much zeal.

<br/>

**12/28/24, Day 17**: 2.11mi easy. Either fairly low condition right now or just had a long day outside before I ran. Something seemed to be fatigued, and hopefully it was not just the 4 mile run at 10 minute pace that made me like this. If it is, no worries, I'm just at a worse position than I thought. There's just too much good food at home maybe.

<br/>

**12/27/24, Day 16**: 4.15mi at 10:00/mi pace. forgot to write it down

<br/>

**12/26/24, Day 15**: 2.22mi easy. too rainy today

<br/>

**12/25/24, Day 14**: 1.56mi easy. merry christmas. leave me alone

<br/>

**12/24/24, Day 13**: 3.63mi tempo? Most exciting run so far! Christmas Eve, exploring many small neighborhoods, and just enjoying all the holiday lights in the area. All around one of the best runs you can ask for. I got to go through so many little light arches too. Everytime I saw lights I felt like running faster, and I didn't feel tired. Probably a combination of adrenaline and the fact that I have been taking it easy recently. Go one more ^

<br/>

**12/23/24, Day 12**: 1.21mi easy. Almost didn't run today since it was so late in the evening after a big meal. Might start running in the morning again tomorrow. There seems to be a constant conflict between wanting to run in the evenings and the mornings. Running evening into next day morning seems like such a short period in between runs, and sometimes I procrastinate the run into the evening even though I have been on a morning streak, which makes it hard to go back to morning.

I've also looked into a book called *Daniel's Running Formula*, by Jack Daniels. A lot of people say that the book is good for incorporating structure and accurately predicting race day pace, but so far I have just been intrigued about his approach to running. There are so many aspects of running that I seem to overlook, and when applying a science to the training I'm starting to understand the purpose of different aspects of becoming faster. Anyways, I hope to eventually become more knowledgeable on what I can do by myself to improve myself.

<br/>

**12/22/24, Day 11**: 1.19mi, super gassed. Just played basketball with some friends beforehand, and the run felt like the last mile of a 5k. There is something to say about continuing the streak in ratios; I'm just getting something in no matter how much I don't want to run that day. Hopefully I can keep up this mentality though.

<br/>

**12/21/24, Day 10**: 4.98mi moderate pace. Day 10! Wow, it seems like such a good start but so little at the same time. Also, what better way to have a day ten then to receive some supporting words from a fan (a good friend lol). Ultimately, I write these posts for myself, but if just one other person reads this post and is left with a positive impact, I would be extremely happy and more motivated myself. I ran around the neighborhood and past my high school today, and there were some great renovations to the tennis courts. They look amazing. Great run, and the weather was interesting because there was expected to be rain, but when I ran there were only heavy clouds, and it seemed like the temperature was almost warmer. Not so cold of mornings are always great.

<br/>

**12/20/24, Day 9**: 4.29mi super easy. This is probably what easy should feel like, but it is extremely slow. Able to talk to others with no extra effort. So slow, however, that after the run my knees feel somewhat irritated or inflamed. Must have been just the amount of time on feet; still not used to running for long periods. Anyways, it's a lot easier to run with other people. Should try doing that more often. 

<br/>

**12/19/24, Day 8**: 4.74mi mentally easy, but according to my watch heartrate, threshold. Probably never going to run through big street areas again, especially during morning traffic since the traffic lights are extremely annoying. The run seemed almost like a weird fartlek with a lot of complete stops. Still don't know whether i should completely stop the watch or just record a lap at each stop to save the pace. Glad to get it done early in the day though. Quads are also relatively sore, I've definitely not been exercising well before this and still getting back into stride.

<br/>

**12/18/24, Day 7**: 2.40mi easy. Running at night has grown on me. It is great to run around the neighborhood and reminisce about all the people and see all the bright Christmas lights out there. There are some crazy Christmas setups around. Maybe should still try running during mornings. 

<br/>

**12/17/24, Day 6**: 2.80mi at 9:43/mi. Honestly only did this because I saw the daily run and needed to keep it up again. Currently getting back into the habit, especially since I have nothing to do right now in particular. Eventually going to switch to morning running hopefully, and I also want to stretch more. Need more places to run around home, seems fairly boring around here. 

<br/>

**12/16/24, Day 5**: 2.12mi, 11:09/mi. Using a Garmin Forerunner 935 today, obtained a used one. I have mixed feelings about it, but I know it will be more helpful in the long run. 

<br/>

*Break due to finals*

<br/>

**12/05/24, Day 4**: 3.17 mi, 1 mile threshold at 7:36. Not much to say today, and I honestly thought that I could do a bit better. I feel like 8:27 pace for 10k sounds a lot better than this. Only way to improve is to keep going.

<br/>

**12/04/24, Day 3**: 1.9 miles easy, 9:05/mi. A couple ideas came to me today. First of all, this run today is a testament to the detriments of procrastination. I had time this morning, yet I felt too lazy to get up to run. Come evening, I still had homework to do, and in the end didn't run until after 10pm. Not a good situation, especially if I'm in a situation at the end of the day where I can't run because I am out somewhere, and therefore a big waste of mental energy and time. Second, I mentioned before about the idea of no zero days. However, one can only greatly improve at something by spending time doing it. Therefore, it's a matter of perspective. If you go into something thinking that you just need to get a bit done consistently, will you make leaps and bounds? Probably not. Consistency is just a foolproof way to rack up time spent. However, the driven will enjoy the process and in turn greatly progress. Two sides of the same coin. Lastly, I was thinking of this idea of habits. Consistency is the basis of habits, and habits constitute change. But why is it so hard to form? Many people say that if you consistently do something for 2 weeks/1 month/X amount of time, it becomes natural. But the problem is, one can't dedicate so much time to something new everyday without considerable effort. Not only are you trying to form a new habit, this extra block of time needs to replace something else you have been doing before then. Some might say, yeah, there's so much time people waste daily on their phones, entertainment, etc. But this "waste" of time is a habit, too. It's just a bad habit. And so when people say a habit becomes natural after a certain amount of time, how many days have you spent building up a "wasteful" habit? It's hard to just drop that for something new, even if you know it is unproductive. Anyways, I hope no one else is running at 10pm.

<br/>

**12/03/24**: 2.98 miles kind of tempo. Strava says 9:19/mi, and based off my recent 52:29 10k, which is 8 minutes 27 a mile, seems a little slow. I was breathing hard. Need to configure garmin watch that I have, so I can get more insight into data. Finals are coming up, so hopefully I can keep up the daily run. Seems to me that there is just so much time in the day in which I can be more productive, yet it's tough to change out of bad habits, like being on the phone or youtube. I have to say this log is partially in inspiration of Brock Kelly's (youtuber) the daily mile. Also, building on top of that, habits don't need to be so black and white. Believe that, in this case, I have to go out and run a certain distance every day seems to only put more inertia on habits your are trying to build. I read a great [blog post](https://knhash.in/streaks-ratios-not-absolutes/) in which the author described an idea of no zero days. "Not to look at streaks as a binary sequence of 0s and 1s, but as a sequence of floating point values." I don't feel like running X miles today. Try just running 1. I don't feel like running in general. Maybe just take a walk outside. Just avoid staying at zero. And in the end, what you are trying to achieve is consistency of effort, not the perfect streak of runs.

<br/>

**12/02/24**: 2.3 miles easy pace. Simple run today, the point of it is to be consistent. No focus on structure or pacing, just running. Been out for many weeks, so I just need to be back on my feet building mileage. Excited to get back into running, especially since now I want to focus more time doing actual research in building a training plan.
