**The Mortality of Life**

Slow but stubborn

Long yet little

Colder and colder still.

<br/>

There are times in life you keep looking back upon and think what went wrong, or what you could have done, and regret forms like a worm through soft soil.

The present and future are where lessons are realized.

“Take my advice and live for a long, long time. Because the maddest thing a man can do in this life is to let himself die.” -Don Quixote
